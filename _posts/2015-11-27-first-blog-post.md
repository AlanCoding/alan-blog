This is a post in markup format, and I'm just getting started with the
setup, so I'm mainly writing this to test if it registers and links
in the front page correctly. But since I'm here, I might try some other
markup tricks while I'm at it.

{% highlight python %}
[kwargs[key] for key in input_dict if key in kwargs]
{% endhighlight %}

This is a fun snippet of code that copies the contents of the kwargs,
for the keys in input_dict
but only if kwargs only has a key with that value. It's not tremendously
insightful, but it's kind of an interesting scenario.
